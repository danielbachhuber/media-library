## Development Setup

1. Install Node.js and NPM
1. Install the package dependencies: from the theme root, `npm install`
1. Install Grunt globally: `npm install -g grunt-cli`
1. Build: from the theme root, `grunt build`

### Watch and Live Reload

After completing the steps for development setup, Sass files can be automatically compiled by typing `grunt watch` at the theme root.  When the `watch` task is running, updates can be automatically refreshed in the browser using Live Reload.  Live Reload can be accomplised using a browser plugin or various other methods.  See https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch#live-reloading.
